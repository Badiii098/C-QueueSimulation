# ðŸš† Train Passenger Queue Simulation

This is a simple **train passenger queue simulation program** written in **C language** that demonstrates how to manage data using arrays and queues (linked lists).

---

ðŸ§¾ **What is it?**  
A program that stores passenger data in a static table (array) and simulates real-time queue operations using a linked list for enqueue and dequeue processing.

ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose:**  
To demonstrate basic data structure concepts such as arrays, structs, and linked lists in the context of a train passenger queue system.

ðŸ’» **Built with:**  
- C programming language  
- Standard Console I/O  
- Dynamic memory allocation (for the queue)

---

ðŸ“Œ **Features:**  
- Add passenger data to a table  
- Display all passenger records  
- Enqueue passengers to the waiting queue  
- Dequeue (remove) passenger from the queue  
- Display current queue state before and after removal

---

ðŸ§ª **How to Use:**  
1. Compile the file using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc train_queue.c -o train_queue
